# Working Workflow

You want to contribute to the DShop? Please use these workflow -  or suggest a change in the [ideas section](https://github.com/open-marketplace-applications/dshop/discussions/categories/ideas) of our [discussion board](https://github.com/open-marketplace-applications/dshop/discussions).


1. Choose or create an [Issue](https://github.com/open-marketplace-applications/dshop/issues).

2. Check if there is a PR - if now, if not create one:

    - Go to your IDE (We recommend [Visial Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
    - Create a new branch, use a tag (`feature`, `fix`, or `docs`) and a descriptive name. Example: `feature/<descriptive-name-of-your-feature>`
    - Push your new branch and create a PR.
    - Add a description, assign yourself and add some labels.

        Tip: Add this to the issue description, to close the issue automatically after merge:

        ```
        closes Issue #<issue_number>
        ```

        Example:
        ```bash
        closes Issue #42
        ```
    - Create it as a `Draft Pull Request`. (Press the small arrow on the "Create pull request" Button).

3. Do you work on this branch and commit often!
4. If you're done with the work - add "important notes" to review your branch and add minimal two `reviewers` and press the `Ready for review" button.
5. If the review is green - you can merge it! - otherwise fix the requested changes and ask again for a review.
